# DeX Trading Agent - AI-Powered Trading System

![DeX CyberAgent](./public/logo.svg)

## 🚀 Overview

DeX Trading Agent is an advanced AI-driven trading system for Hyperliquid perpetual futures. It features live and paper trading modes, dynamic multi-chart analysis, interactive risk management, and secure browser-based API key storage. The system leverages DeepSeek and Qwen3 Max AI for intelligent market analysis and supports both mainnet and testnet trading.

**Important:** Hyperliquid is an independent Layer 1 blockchain (Chain ID 998 for testnet, not Arbitrum or Ethereum). The platform uses its own consensus mechanism (HyperBFT) and native token (HYPE).

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **pnpm** (v8 or higher)
- **Git**

You'll also need API keys for:
- **Hyperliquid API Wallet** (Recommended - Agent wallet with no withdrawal permissions)
  - Generate at https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API
  - Provides: Master Account Address + Agent Wallet Private Key
  - **Security**: Agent wallets can trade but CANNOT withdraw funds
- **OpenRouter** (for AI analysis)

**Network Information:**
- **Hyperliquid Mainnet**: Independent L1 blockchain
- **Hyperliquid Testnet**: Chain ID 998, RPC: https://rpc.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/evm

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for Local Development)

Docker provides an isolated, consistent environment for running the DeX Trading Agent locally with your API keys.

#### Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** installed (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Docker Compose** (included with Docker Desktop)
- **Convex account** with your project deployed
- **API Keys** (OpenRouter, CryptoPanic)

#### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**

### 2. Install Dependencies
```
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Convex

Install Convex CLI globally (if not already installed)
```
pnpm add -g convex
```

If convex fails to start try
```
export PNPM_HOME="~/.local/share/pnpm"
export PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"
pnpm add -g convex
```

Initialize and deploy Convex backend
```
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Create a new Convex project (if first time)
- Generate your `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` URL
- Start the Convex development server
- Watch for changes in your `src/convex/` directory

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

VITE_CONVEX_URL=<your-convex-deployment-url>
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-openrouter-api-key>


**Note:** The `VITE_CONVEX_URL` is automatically generated when you run `npx convex dev`. You can find it in the Convex dashboard or in the terminal output.

### 5. Run the Development Server

In a new terminal (keep Convex dev running):
```
pnpm dev
```

Within VITE, in order to show the webapp
```
--host
```


The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 6. Configure API Keys

You have two options for configuring API keys:

#### Option A: Client-Side Storage (Browser LocalStorage)
1. Navigate to the application in your browser
2. You'll be prompted to set up API keys on first launch
3. Choose your connection method:
   - **🔗 Wallet Connection** (Read-only): Connect MetaMask to view positions without exposing private keys
     - Supports Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Hyperliquid Testnet (Chain ID 998)
   - **🔑 API Keys** (Full Trading - RECOMMENDED): Enter credentials for automated AI trading
     - **Master Account Address** (Your main wallet address from https://app.hyperliquid.xyz)
     - **Agent Wallet Private Key** (Generated at https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API - starts with "0x", 66 characters)
     - **Agent Wallet Address** (Optional, for tracking)
     - **OpenRouter API Key** (from https://openrouter.ai)
     - **Security**: Agent wallets can trade but CANNOT withdraw funds - much safer!
   - **🎮 Demo Mode**: Try the platform with simulated perpetual futures trading

**Security Note:** All API keys are stored locally in your browser's localStorage and never sent to any server.

#### Option B: Backend Environment Variables (For Self-Hosted/Local Deployment)

For local or self-hosted deployments, you can configure API keys in the backend environment:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`):

VITE_CONVEX_URL=<your-convex-deployment-url>
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-openrouter-api-key>

**Note:** The `VITE_CONVEX_URL` is automatically generated when you run `npx convex dev`. You can find it in the Convex dashboard or in the terminal output.

### 7. Run the Development Server

In a new terminal (keep Convex dev running):
```
pnpm dev
```

Within VITE, in order to show the webapp
```
--host
```


The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 📦 Building for Production
```
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

## 🔒 Security & Risk Management

### Security Best Practices
- **Never share your private keys** with anyone
- Use **Hyperliquid Agent Wallets** (recommended) - they can trade but CANNOT withdraw funds
- API keys are stored locally in browser localStorage only
- Start with **Paper Trading** to test strategies risk-free
- Use **Testnet** before trading on Mainnet
- Regularly **review trading logs** and performance metrics

### Risk Controls
- **Margin Monitoring**: Real-time margin usage calculation including unrealized PnL
- **Auto-Trading Pause**: System automatically pauses when margin exceeds 80%
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: All position closures require explicit confirmation
- **Liquidation Warnings**: Alerts when approaching dangerous margin levels
- **Position Limits**: Configurable maximum position sizes and leverage caps

## 🔄 Auto-Update Feature

The application automatically checks for updates from the GitHub repository every hour. When a new version is available:

1. **Update Notification**: A notification banner appears at the top of the dashboard
2. **Version Information**: Shows current version vs. latest available version
3. **Release Notes**: Displays a preview of the latest release notes
4. **Update Instructions**: Provides deployment-specific update commands

## Comment

inspired by Nof1's Alpha Arena 
https://nof1.ai/

I saw how well DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3 Max did during the competition...

But it's obvious People at Nof1 have never traded before in their life. since I didn't see any Take Profit or Stop Loss being set at all.
They just YOLOed $60k between 6 LLMs.

So I figured I'd make one myself..

Feel free to review the source code or fork it.
I even added the repo to DeepWiki
> https://deepwiki.com/VenTheZone/dex-trading-agent

Reviews and suggestions are appreciated.
